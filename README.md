#### **Installation**

---

The steps you need to take to install this are:

1. Figure out what your read me needs to look like.
1. Install dependencies which must include inquirer.
1. Write the questions for the user to be prompted by inquirer.
1. Make functions to return the values for each section of the README.
1. Assemble the returns into a file and then write it to the markdown file.

#### **Trials**

---

This project taught me how to use export.module extremely well. You can export many functions at once with {} around them. In addition, I learned how to use inquirer quite well. The when function is truly amazing and versatile.

#### **Usage**

---

The usage of this CLI is fairly simple. You start with a command prompt.
Start the program and follow the prompts. Enter values as you wish. If you select no to a section, that section will not be produced. Once all the prompts have been answered a file named how you chose will populate.

The application is deployed [here](https://github.com/jerler1/README-Generator).

#### **Credits**

Thanks to Bradley for the good discussion on exporting modules.
